- **Configuration Management:** Implement Ansible for application deployment and configuration management, ensuring that applications are correctly set up and running as intended.

- **Modular Design:** The project is structured in a modular way, allowing easy modifications and scalability. Users can add or remove components as needed without affecting the overall architecture.

- **Version Control:** The project is hosted on GitHub, enabling version control and collaboration among team members.

- **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation is provided, including setup instructions, usage guidelines, and examples to help users get started quickly.

## Technologies Used
- **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code
